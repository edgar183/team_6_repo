                Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving across water. It is distinguished 
                from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades 
                on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in which the 
                paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle to 
                pull front-to-back on one side and then the other in rotation.Most kayaks 
                have closed decks, although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are both growing 
                in popularity.

                Kayaks were created thousands of years ago by the Inuit, formerly known as 
                Eskimos, of the northern Arctic regions. They used driftwood and sometimes the 
                skeleton of whale, to construct the frame of the kayak, and animal skin, particularly 
                seal skin was used to create the body. The main purpose for creating the kayak, 
                which literally translates to "hunter's boat" was for hunting and fishing. 
                The kayak's stealth capabilities allowed for the hunter to sneak up behind 
                animals on the shoreline and successfully catch their prey
