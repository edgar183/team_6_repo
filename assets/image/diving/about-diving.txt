Not for the faint of heart or those who feel claustrophobic. The ocean is the last place apart from space that man has yet to conquer. We have mapped more of the stars than we have of the ocean floor. However this doesn't mean that we can't reach it as easily! Diving offers the best view into the world of aquatic life aside from aquariums. 

Learning is a difficult process however that time your first open water dive begins will be an unforgettable experience, breathing among the fishes, corals and water mammals that share our planet with us. The process takes a couple of days and it can be dangerous if you dont listen to your instructor, pay attention to the volume of your oxygen tank or see some of the more volatile animals.
